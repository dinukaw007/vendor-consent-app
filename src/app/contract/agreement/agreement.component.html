  <p><b>Responsibility for Public Postings and Content</b></p>

  <p>Responsibility for what is posted in public areas of the Site lies with each User – you alone are responsible for
    the material you post or otherwise make available in public areas of the Site. You alone are responsible for
    assessing the credibility of other User postings. We do not control the material that you or others may post or
    otherwise make available in such areas, and you understand that we have no obligation to monitor any such material
    or to edit or delete it. However, we reserve the right to do so. We are not a publisher of user posts and we are
    not responsible for their accuracy or legality.</p>

  <p>You also understand and agree that any action or inaction by us or any of our directors, officers, stockholders,
    employees, consultants, agents or representatives (collectively, "Our Representatives") to prevent, restrict,
    redress or regulate content, or to implement other enforcement measures against any content, conduct or potential
    Terms of Use violation is undertaken voluntarily and in good faith, and you expressly agree that neither we nor any
    of Our Representatives shall be liable to you or anyone else for any action or inaction to prevent, restrict,
    redress, or regulate content, or to implement other enforcement measures against any content, conduct or potential
    violation of these Terms of Use.</p>

  <p>Although Our Representatives may moderate content, conduct and Terms of Use compliance on the Site at our
    discretion, Our Representatives have no authority to make binding commitments, promises or representations to
    anyone that they or anyone else on our behalf will "take care" of any alleged problem or complaint, or that they or
    anyone else on our behalf will otherwise stop, cure or prevent any problem, content, conduct or purported Terms of
    Use violation from occurring or recurring. Accordingly, you further agree that any representation (written or
    verbal) by any of Our Representatives (or by anyone else acting on our behalf or by anyone purportedly acting on
    our behalf) that we (including but not limited to any of Our Representatives, anyone else acting on our behalf, or
    anyone purportedly acting on our behalf) would or would not prevent, restrict, redress or regulate content
    (including, without limitation, screen, block, moderate, review, remove, terminate, delete, edit or otherwise stop,
    cure or exclude any content), or to implement other enforcement measures against any content, conduct or potential
    or purported Terms of Use violation is superseded by this provision and is nonbinding and unenforceable.
    Specifically, you agree that we, Our Representatives and anyone else authorized to act on our behalf shall in no
    circumstance be liable as a result of any representation that we, Our Representative or anyone else on our behalf
    would or would not restrict or redress any content, conduct or potential or purported Terms of Use violation. This
    paragraph may not be modified, waived or released except by a written agreement, dated and signed by our Chief
    Executive Officer and dated and signed by the individual or entity to whom the modification, waiver or release is
    granted.</p>
